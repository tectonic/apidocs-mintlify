- **MAJOR** version: Incremented for incompatible changes.
- **MINOR** version: Incremented for minor breaking changes.

This documentation will always refer to the latest version of the API. In the case of version updates, the changelog below indicates when these occurred. The latest version of the API is 2.3 which is reflected in the Accept header.

```bash
application/vnd.Creative Force.v2.3+json
application/vnd.Creative Force.v2.3+xml
```

To use an old API version, replace 2.3 with the version number.

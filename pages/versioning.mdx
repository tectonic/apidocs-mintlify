title: "Versioning"
---

At Award Force, we use semantic versioning, which follows this format:

- **MAJOR** version: Incremented for incompatible changes.
- **MINOR** version: Incremented for minor breaking changes.

This documentation will always refer to the latest version of the API. In the case of version updates, the changelog below indicates when these occurred. The latest version of the API is 2.3 which is reflected in the Accept header. `application/vnd.Creative Force.v2.3+json` `application/vnd.Creative Force.v2.3+xml`

To use an old API version, replace `2.3` with the version number.
